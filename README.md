MMO Multiplatform video game to create your own solar systems and life on each planet, users can visit their solar systems, explore together past space-time locations and share rewards.

We found that space exploration is not a highly requested topic to be studied by young population; in fact, 34% of the world’s population doesn’t know which is the correct order of the planets in the solar system, there are plenty of popular games today in mobile or console devices but most of them are poorly educative, using the planets textures captured by Nasa’s satellites we’re able to collect data of individual planets depending on its chemical composition and create exact simulations, also we used WindMap’s endpoints into WebViews that will eventually be used by users to map their terrain meshes and learn scientific terms such as maths, physics and chemistry; user can create their own solar systems, galaxies and planets to develop environmental conditions to develop life on the user’s planets.
